Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

Tasks

0. Multiple mains: n most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. 

1. Like, comment, subscribe: Copy this main file. Comment out (dont delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Dont add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.

2. 0 > 972?: Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

Line count will not be checked for this task.

3. Leap year: This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
